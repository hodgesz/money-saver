#### Test Coverage Requirements

**Minimum Coverage Thresholds** (Enforced in CI/CD):
- Statements: 70%
- Branches: 70%
- Functions: 70%
- Lines: 70%

**Coverage by Component Type**:
- **Utilities & Business Logic**: 90%+ coverage (High Priority)
- **React Components**: 75%+ coverage (Medium Priority)
