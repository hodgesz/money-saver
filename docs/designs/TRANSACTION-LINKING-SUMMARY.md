# Transaction Linking Feature - Executive Summary

**Feature Name**: Amazon-to-Credit-Card Transaction Linking
**Phase**: Phase 2.1 - Intelligent Transaction Parsing (Enhancement)
**Priority**: P1 (High)
**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 weeks
**Design Date**: 2025-10-25
**Status**: Design Complete, Ready for Implementation

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

This feature enables users to link itemized Amazon order details to their credit card statement charges, providing full visibility into what makes up each Amazon purchase without manual data entry.

### Problem Statement

When users import:
1. **Chase Credit Card CSV**: Shows total Amazon charges (e.g., "$82.97 AMAZON.COM*M12AB34CD")
2. **Amazon Order CSV**: Shows itemized line items (e.g., "Wireless Mouse $24.99", "USB Cable $8.99")

Currently, these exist as separate, unconnected transactions. Users cannot easily see what items comprise each credit card charge.

### Solution

Build intelligent matching logic that:
- Links credit card charges (parent) to Amazon line items (children)
- Uses date proximity (±3-5 days) and amount matching algorithms
- Provides confidence scoring (0-100) for match quality
- Supports manual linking/unlinking
- Displays parent-child relationships in the UI

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Database Schema Changes

```sql
-- Add to transactions table
ALTER TABLE transactions ADD COLUMN:
  parent_transaction_id UUID REFERENCES transactions(id),
  link_confidence INTEGER CHECK (link_confidence BETWEEN 0 AND 100),
  link_type TEXT CHECK (link_type IN ('auto', 'manual', 'suggested')),
  link_metadata JSONB
```

**Key Features**:
- Self-referencing foreign key pattern (single table)
- 7 strategic indexes for performance
- Enhanced RLS policies for security
- Flexible JSONB metadata storage

### Matching Algorithm (5-Phase Pipeline)

```
Phase 1: Pre-processing
  ↓ Normalize dates, group by user, sort by date
Phase 2: Candidate Generation
  ↓ Filter by date window (±5 days)
Phase 3: Match Scoring
  ↓ Calculate 0-100 confidence (date 40% + amount 50% + order 10%)
Phase 4: Match Selection
  ↓ Choose best match, detect ambiguity
Phase 5: Post-processing
  ↓ Allocate tax/shipping, create links
```

**Confidence Levels**:
- **≥90**: EXACT - Auto-link with high confidence
- **70-89**: PARTIAL - Good match, minor review
- **50-69**: FUZZY - Requires manual review
- **<50**: UNMATCHED - No viable match

### UI Components

```
TransactionList
├── LinkedTransactionRow (parent, expandable)
│   ├── ChildTransactionRow (indented, unlinkable)
│   ├── ChildTransactionRow
│   └── AddChildButton
├── TransactionLinkingModal (manual linking)
└── AutoLinkReviewPanel (suggestions)
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Row Level Security (RLS)
```sql
-- Users can only see their own transactions and linked children
CREATE POLICY transactions_select_policy ON transactions
  FOR SELECT USING (
    user_id = auth.uid() OR
    parent_transaction_id IN (
      SELECT id FROM transactions WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
```

### Data Validation
- ✅ Prevent cross-user linking (RLS enforced)
- ✅ Prevent circular references (CHECK constraint)
- ✅ Validate confidence scores (0-100 range)
- ✅ Audit trail in link_metadata
